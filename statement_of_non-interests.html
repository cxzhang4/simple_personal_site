        <h2>A hopefully non-controversial list of things I do not like</h2>

        These specific activities are not only themselves unpleasant, but the descriptions hopefully give a broader sense of how I think.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Programming language wars</b> are exhausting and astonishingly unproductive. 
                    I would be happy if I didn't waste another moment discussing this with someone who was unwilling to put in the effort to learn, or unaware of the scope of their own ignorance.
                </p>

                    <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">Peter Norvig</a> and <a href="https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/in-2017-learn-every-language-59b11f68eee">Oz Nova</a> have been highly influential on my thoughts on learning programming.

                <p>
                    Replacing my own writing with a large language model. Especially in English, the language in which I can best articulate myself, I choose my words carefully. 
                    Even if an LLM <i>could</i> write a "better" version, the words wouldn't be mine.
