        <h2>A hopefully non-controversial list of things I do not like</h2>

        These specific activities are not only themselves unpleasant, but the descriptions hopefully give a broader sense of how I think.

            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Programming language wars</b> are exhausting and astonishingly unproductive. 
                I would be happy if I didn't waste another moment discussing this with someone who was unwilling to put in the effort to learn, or unaware of the scope of their own ignorance.
