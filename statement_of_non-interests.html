        <h2>A list of things I do not like</h2>

        These specific activities are not only themselves unpleasant, but the descriptions hopefully give a broader sense of how I think.

                    Programming language wars are exhausting.  
                    Although specific programming languages clearly have advantages and disadvantages, your choice is often dictated by the practicalities of your situation.
                    Too often, someone's opinion is driven largely by their unwillingness to learn something new, and learning more languages is usually a good thing.
                    <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">Peter Norvig</a> and <a href="https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/in-2017-learn-every-language-59b11f68eee">Oz Nova</a> have been highly influential on my thoughts on learning programming,
                    as was my formal computer science education.

                    Replacing my own writing with a large language model. Especially in English, the language in which I can best articulate myself, I choose my words carefully. 
                    Even if an LLM <i>could</i> write a "better" version, the words wouldn't be mine.
