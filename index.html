            I'm a master's student in statistics and data science at the University of Munich. 
            I studied statistics and computer science at the University of Illinois. 
            My academic interests include causal inference and statistical modeling in general.
            I think a lot about how to explain complex things in an understandable manner, and how to communicate more effectively in general. For more, read

            In my free time, I like to sing karaoke; play tennis and table tennis; and <a href="songs/list-songs.html">write technical parodies of popular songs</a>.
