        <h2>High-level interests</h2>

        <p>
            I want to be right more often. I want to be wrong less often.
        </p>

        <p>
            I study <b>statistics</b> in order to faithfully and accurately shape my decisions and opinions using data, thereby accomplishing the above goals. 
            I am interested in all manner of applications, from business problems to the social, life, and physical sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use computers as a primary tool to accomplish this task. 
            Through studying <b>computer science</b>, I have come to enjoy constructing clean, readable code to solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I have continued to deepen my understanding of the above topics, I have developed a greater appreciation for the <b>mathematics</b> underlying these fields. 
            Furthermore, I have seen its power as an educational tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the while, I seek to clearly communicate what I have learned and what I believe, and I hope people enjoy and benefit from these communications.
        </p>

        <h2>Specific subfields of interest</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Causal inference</b>: gives us tools to answer the myriad interesting questions of the form, "did A cause B, and by how much"? 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Hypothesis testing</b>: gives a framework for drawing conclusions from data. 
                I like to think carefully about which conclusions I can and should draw from a data analysis, 
                and hypothesis testing frameworks guide people in doing so. 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Information theory</b>: gives a language for describing uncertainty.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Unsupervised learning</b>: leverages computation to uncover hidden structure in data, 
                allowing people to learn things that otherwise would have been difficult to observe.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Reproducibility</b>: is more or less a necessary condition of good science or analysis. 
                At minimum, your future self will thank you for caring about it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other things that have piqued my interest</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Random number generation</b>: uses very many interesting algorithms to do something fundamentally important 
                that we often take for granted.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Copulas</b>: solve a statistical modeling problem in a very cool way.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>The bootstrap</b>: is an amazingly simple and clever way to get more out of the data we have.
                (Nonparametric statistics in general is very interesting, and other resampling methods hold similar but lesser appeal.)
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Missing data imputation</b>: is a ubiquitous problem whose solutions really get at the heart of 
                our understanding of our data and how we can analyze it properly.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Exploratory data analysis</b>: is a fundamental skill that is almost never learned or taught explicitly.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Decision theory</b>: seems like the theoretical framework I've been chasing my entire life, 
                and it can even be thought of as synonymous with statistics.
