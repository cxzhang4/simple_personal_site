        <p>
            I'm Carson Zhang.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I'm a master's student in statistics and data science at the University of Munich. 
            I studied statistics and computer science at the University of Illinois.
        </p>

        <p>
            My technical/academic interests include causal inference, information theory, 
            machine learning, statistical methodology, algorithm design, software development, and psychology. 
            I think almost constantly about how to explain
            complex things in an understandable manner, and how to communicate more clearly in general. My blog (mostly technical) will be linked here.
        </p>

        <p>
            The people who have had the most profoundly positive impacts on my life have been 
            endlessly empathetic and patient. I strive to do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I like to sing karaoke; play tennis and table tennis; play chess; write technical versions of popular songs; 
            read the prefaces to instructional books; and re-read fiction books from my childhood. 
            I'm actively learning Mandarin and German.
