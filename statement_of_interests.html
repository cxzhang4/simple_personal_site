        <h2>High-level interests</h2>

        <p>
            I want to be right more often. I want to be wrong less often.
        </p>

        <p>
            To accomplish the above goals using data, I study <b>statistics</b> in order to faithfully and accurately shape my decisions and opinions. 
            I am interested in all manner of applications, from business problems to the social, life, and physical sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Computers are an invaluable tool for accomplishing these tasks. 
            Therefore, I also chose to study <b>computer science</b>, and I have come to enjoy constructing clean, readable code to solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            For everything that I do, I seek to explain and communicate it clearly.
        </p>

        <h2>Specific areas of interest</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Causal inference</b> gives us tools to answer the myriad interesting questions of the form, "did A cause B, and by how much"? 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Hypothesis testing</b> gives a framework for drawing conclusions from data. 
                I like to think carefully about which conclusions I can and should draw from a data analysis, 
                and hypothesis testing frameworks guide people in doing so. 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Information theory</b> gives tools and a language for describing uncertainty.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Unsupervised learning</b> leverages computation to uncover hidden structure in data, 
                allowing people to learn things that otherwise would have been difficult to observe.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Computational reproducibility</b> is more or less a necessary condition of good science or analysis. 
                At minimum, your future self will thank you for caring about it.
