            I'm a master's student in statistics and data science at the University of Munich. 
            I studied statistics and computer science at the University of Illinois. 
            I think a lot about how to explain complex things in an understandable manner, and how to communicate more effectively in general. For more, read

            I'm utterly exhausted of programming language wars, and nearly always prefer not to participate. I very rarely, if ever, use LLM tools when I write.

            In my free time, I like to sing karaoke; play tennis and table tennis; and <a href="songs/list-songs.html">write technical parodies of popular songs</a>.
