        <p>
            I'm Carson Zhang.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I'm a master's student in statistics and data science at the University of Munich. 
            I studied statistics and computer science at the University of Illinois.

            My academic interests include causal inference, information theory, 
            machine learning, random number generation, algorithm design, and software development. I think a lot about how to explain
            complex things in an understandable manner, and how to communicate more effectively in general. For more, read <a href="https://carsons-technical-blog.netlify.app">my technical blog</a>.

            In my free time, I like to sing karaoke; play tennis and table tennis; play chess; and <a href="songs/list-songs.html">write technical parodies of popular songs</a>.
            I'm actively learning Mandarin and German.
