        <h1>Style</h1>

        <h3>Based on "Style", by Taylor Swift</h3>

        <h3>Written for CS 126, a first-year undergraduate course on software design</h3>

            Midnight, your code is due, you don’t know what to write<br>
            Long lines, at office hours, you’re running out of time<br>
            What will you do, oh,<br>
            There’s no time left just commit something to review<br>
            (To review)<br>
            Well I could just tell you to code but I<br>
            Know exactly where that goes and I<br>
            Want you to think about design<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You got that one main function that’s 500 lines<br>
            And I got that modular, encapsulated design<br>
            But when you know people will read the code that you write<br>
            Remember to use good style, remember to use good style<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You started way too late so your code doesn’t work<br>
            Without any tests, is it correct? You’re just not sure<br>
            And when you write code you don’t think about your design<br>
            Remember to use good style, remember to use good style<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            So it goes, he says he’ll write tests but you know he won’t<br>
            Variables named “flag” or “temp”, you don’t know what he wrote (Hm yeah)<br>
            It looks like this code was written by someone from Michigan (from Michigan)<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Well I might be too hard on you ’cause I<br>
            Used to do the same things and I<br>
            I said I’ve been there too a few times<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            'Cause you got that one main function that’s 500 lines<br>
            And I got that modular, encapsulated design<br>
            But when you know people will read the code that you write<br>

            Write good code<br>
            Just write good code<br>
            Yeah just write good code, oh<br>
        </p>
