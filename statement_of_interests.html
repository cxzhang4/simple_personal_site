        <h2>High-level statement</h2>

        <p>
            I want to be right more often. I want to be wrong less often.
        </p>

        <p>
            I study <b>statistics</b> in order to faithfully and accurately shape my decisions and opinions using data, thereby accomplishing the above goals. 
            I am interested in all manner of applications, from business to the social, life, and physical sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use computers as a primary tool to accomplish this task. 
            Through studying <b>computer science</b>, I have come to enjoy the act of constructing clean, readable code to solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I have continued to deepen my understanding of the above topics, I have developed a greater appreciation for the <b>mathematics</b> underlying these fields. 
            Furthermore, I have come to enjoy mathematics in its own right, and appreciate it as an educational tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the while, I seek to clearly communicate what I have learned and what I believe, and I hope people enjoy and benefit from these communications.
