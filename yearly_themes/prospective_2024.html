        </header>

        <p>
            (I had to look up the opposite of "retrospective".)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I like <a href="https://www.themesystem.com/">CGP Grey and Myke Hurley's "Theme System"</a>, and I believe that discussing it in a public forum like this will help me pursue my chosen theme more effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            For 2024, the theme is <b>intentionality</b>. Among other things, this means:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Asking myself whether I enjoy doing something, or if habits and external factors have unduly driven me to do something self-destructive or wasteful.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Finding purposes for my actions and keeping them at the forefront of my mind, instead of doing things because I am supposed to.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Making realistic plans of action that are robust to schedule changes and the like.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Making time to work towards my long-standing goals, for which the plans of action are largely clear and stable.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Giving more attention to whatever I am doing, by choosing a singular focus and removing sources of distraction.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            As of this writing, I won't publish concrete goals (resolution-style), and in theory those goals don't even exist as such. At the end of the year, I'll write up a retrospective about how I pursued this theme.
